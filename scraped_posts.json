        "text": "Today i just thinked that naruto's feudal lords exactly like celestial dragons in one piece. In narrator touch celestial dragons shown like evil and feudal lord as good but both are weaklings who are protected by strong people (onepiece marine, naruto - ninja system). And also they only inherited the title and power even summon powerfull ninjas like celestial dragon summon admiral. What do you you guys think (I'm not a naruto hater)",

        "text": ">!Immortality is the only thing that keeping Shanks alive from Mihawk. He get rid the abyss mark for two reason. Firstly to cut off Imu's connection from then to lose Mihawk interest against him. So he doesn't need to live from fear of being hunted by Mihawk. And that line of Queen Conney fit Mihawk's persona. He don't want to go all out against Shanks because he's a hawk hunting his high valued rabbit for fun. Think of the moment Garling hunting the slaves, but in Mihawk's case Shanks can't die because of the mark.!<",
