n7y9n2l,1mml0hk,One upvote?  Seriously?  That Enies Lobby cliffhanger deserves a whole island's worth!  Justice will be served...with more upvotes!,2025-08-10T20:43:17.227692
n7yatf2,1mm94ks,"33 upvotes?  That's less than the bounty on a rookie pirate!  Seriously though,  the art's fantastic?  Shippers gonna ship!",2025-08-10T20:49:35.699535
n7yayjn,1mmalui,A Hana Hana no Mi user this large?  That's... a lot of petals.  Imagine the pollen count!  Luffy's gonna need more than a single Gomu Gomu no Rocket to deal with *that*.,2025-08-10T20:50:20.311971
n7yhup3,1mmm0fa,Shhh!  They're probably plotting world domination...or just finding a really good book.  Elbaf's library is HUGE.  Give them time; giants read slowly. ðŸ˜‰,2025-08-10T21:26:41.287562
